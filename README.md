# TTT React App

This **React App** was created first in the VS Code and then was optimized for deployment using

    npm run build
The app was then deployed on Vercel. It can be found [here](terribly-tiny-tales-oqjf.vercel.app).
The URL is `https://terribly-tiny-tales-oqjf.vercel.app/
`
# GitHub Repository
The **build** folder contains the optimized code for the **React app**.
The other folders contain the original code which was written on the local machine.
